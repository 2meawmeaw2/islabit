You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

UI and Styling

- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for screen size adjustments.
- Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS for component styling.
- Implement dark mode support using Expo's useColorScheme.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.

Safe Area Management

- Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app.
- Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
- Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
- Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
- Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience.
- Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading with expo-image.
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
- Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.

Navigation

- Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
- Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow.
- Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling.

State Management

- Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state.
- Leverage react-query for data fetching and caching; avoid excessive API calls.
- For complex state management, consider using Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
- Handle URL search parameters using libraries like expo-linking.

Error Handling and Validation

- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
- Implement proper error logging using Sentry or a similar service.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.
- Use expo-error-reporter for logging and reporting errors in production.

Testing

- Write unit tests using Jest and React Native Testing Library.
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows using Detox.
- Use Expo's testing tools for running tests in different environments.
- Consider snapshot testing for components to ensure UI consistency.

Security

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use react-native-encrypted-storage for secure storage of sensitive data.
- Ensure secure communication with APIs using HTTPS and proper authentication.
- Use Expo's Security guidelines to protect your app: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/security/

Internationalization (i18n)

- Use react-native-i18n or expo-localization for internationalization and localization.
- Support multiple languages and RTL layouts.
- Ensure text scaling and font adjustments for accessibility.

Key Conventions

1. Rely on Expo's managed workflow for streamlined development and deployment.
2. Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).
3. Use expo-constants for managing environment variables and configuration.
4. Use expo-permissions to handle device permissions gracefully.
5. Implement expo-updates for over-the-air (OTA) updates.
6. Follow Expo's best practices for app deployment and publishing: https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/
7. Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing extensively on both platforms.

API Documentation

- Use Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

Refer to Expo's documentation for detailed information on Views, Blueprints, and Extensions for best practices.

CURSOR PROJECT RULE: Islamic Habit Tracking Mobile App
You are working on a revolutionary mobile habit tracking app that uses Islamic principles in a never-before-seen way, built with Expo and React Native with Reanimated for animations.
UNIQUE APP CONCEPT:

Salat-Based Time System: Habits are tracked using prayer times as reference points instead of hours/specific times
Intention-Driven Habits: Every habit (even general ones like sports) carries Islamic intention and spiritual purpose
Nafs Strengthening: Focus on building inner strength through small, consistent steps
Islamic Lifestyle Rectification: Complete realignment of daily habits with Islamic principles
Natural Rhythm Integration: App flows with the Islamic day cycle through the five daily prayers

CORE PRINCIPLES:

Always ask for permission before implementing new features or major changes
Explain every piece of code you write in simple, educational terms
Focus on creating the best possible user experience for Muslim users
Keep styling simple, clean, and uncluttered with smooth interactions

MANDATORY BEHAVIORS:

Teaching Mode: Before writing any code, explain what you're about to do and why. After implementation, break down the code functionality in beginner-friendly terms.
Permission-Based Development: Always ask "Should I implement [feature/change]?" and wait for confirmation before proceeding.
Islamic-Aware Development: Understand that this app serves Muslim users with a unique salat-based tracking system and intention-driven approach.
Styling Guidelines:

Adapt and improve the existing theme consistently
Use simple, clean designs - avoid visual clutter
Ensure smooth, polished animations using Reanimated
Design with respect for the spiritual nature of the app

Code Structure: Write clean, well-commented code that's easy to understand and maintain.

STRICT PROHIBITIONS:

Never implement complex features without explaining them thoroughly
Don't add functionality without explicit user approval
Avoid cluttered or overly complex UI designs
Don't use advanced patterns without teaching them step-by-step

TECHNOLOGY FOCUS:

Expo framework best practices
Reanimated for smooth animations
Prayer time integration capabilities
Mobile-first user experience optimization

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
Always explain your reasoning, ask clarifying questions, and ensure the user understands each implementation step before moving forward. Keep in mind the unique spiritual and practical needs this app addresses.
